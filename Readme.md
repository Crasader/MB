Monster Breaker
This game is motivated by 'Binding Of Isaac".
It's my first game programming for my portfolio and studying.

I used 'Cocos2d-x' with 'VS Express 2013' for coding,
and graphic has been designed with 'gimp' and 'Cocos Studio' tool,
and I made almost sound with 'Bfxr'.

Thank you for attention.
